    - Why const char *?
        - (const char) *, not const (char *)
        - user knows string wont be modified
        - compiler knows that string won't be modified (can make optimizations)
            const char *x = "hi";
            function1(x);
            function2(x);
        - thread safety? 
    - static vs dynamic typecasting?
        - C++
            - casting from base class type to derived class type
            - does additional check that the object is actually of the derived
              class type

From pset
    - You know how to see comments, right?
    - get_string() NULL check
    - validation convention

n^2 sorts

O(n log n) sorts
O(n) sorts: radix sort, counting
